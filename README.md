A library of Svelte 3 Material UI components, based on the [Material Design Components - Web](https://material.io/develop/web/).

# Demos

https://sveltematerialui.com

# Installation

You _should_ install the packages individually. Alternatively, you can install all of them at once with the `svelte-material-ui` package.

```sh
# Install the packages individually.
npm install --save-dev @smui/button
npm install --save-dev @smui/card
# ...

# Or, you can install this to get them all.
npm install --save-dev svelte-material-ui
```

# MDC 10 Update!

The latest SMUI, v3 (beta), uses the latest upstream [Material Design Components for Web (MDC)](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web), v10. I've done a lot more than upgrade the version, though! I rewrote SMUI to use the ["Advanced Approach"](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/blob/master/docs/integrating-into-frameworks.md#the-advanced-approach-using-foundations-and-adapters) of integrating with the library, which should make updating to later upstream versions much easier. There should also be fewer bugs, because _Svelte_ is in charge of updating the DOM, instead of MDC.

<sub>I literally used a vacation week to do this.</sub>

## Migration

If you are upgrading from an older version of SMUI to a newer one, it might be worth checking out the [migration doc](MIGRATING.md).

# Usage

Check out the [Webpack template](https://github.com/hperrin/smui-example-webpack) and the [Rollup template](https://github.com/hperrin/smui-example-rollup) for examples.

1. To bundle this in your own code, use a Sass processor (not a Sass Svelte **preprocessor**, but a Sass **processor**). SMUI's `index.js` files import _.scss files_, and they need to be compiled by a Sass processor. SMUI's `*.svelte` files don't include any Sass or CSS, so a Svelte _preprocessor_ is not necessary.
   - Alternatively, you can import components from the `bare.js` files, which don't include any styling. Then you can either import the Sass yourself, or use the `bare.css` files which are precompiled (with the default theme) and packaged with components. Then you can skip the next step, but your [theming options](THEMING.md#theming-the-bare-css) are limited.
   - Note that `node-sass` is deprecated, and SMUI uses features that it doesn't support. You should use [Dart Sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) instead.
2. You must have a `_smui-theme.scss` file in one of your Sass include paths to compile the Sass. That is where you [set the theme variables](THEMING.md). If it's empty, it will use the default theme values from MDC-Web.
3. If you want the Material Icon, Roboto, and Roboto Mono fonts, be sure to include these stylesheets (or include them from a package):
   ```html
   <link
     rel="stylesheet"
     href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons"
   />
   <link
     rel="stylesheet"
     href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,600,700"
   />
   <link
     rel="stylesheet"
     href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto+Mono"
   />
   ```
4. You're now ready to install and use SMUI packages. Here's some example code:

   ```svelte
   <Button on:click={() => alert('Clicked!')}>Just a Button</Button>
   <Button variant="raised"><Label>Raised Button, Using a Label</Label></Button>
   <Button some-arbitrary-prop="placed on the actual button">Button</Button>

   <Fab on:click={() => alert('Clicked!')} extended>
     <Icon class="material-icons" style="margin-right: 12px;">favorite</Icon>
     <Label>Extended FAB</Label>
   </Fab>

   <Textfield bind:value={superText} label="Super Text">
     <HelperText slot="helper"
       >What you put in this box will become super!</HelperText
     >
   </Textfield>

   <script>
     import Button from '@smui/button';
     import Fab from '@smui/fab';
     import Textfield from '@smui/textfield';
     import HelperText from '@smui/textfield/helper-text';
     import { Label, Icon } from '@smui/common';

     let superText = '';
   </script>
   ```

Here are some features you should know about:

- You can add arbitrary properties to all of the components and many of the elements within them.
- You can add actions to the components with `use={[Action1, [Action2, action2Props], Action3]}`.
- You can add props to lower components and elements with "$" props, like `input$maxlength="15"`.
- All [standard UI and transition events](packages/common/forwardEventsBuilder.js#L4) are forwarded on components, input events ("input" and "change") are forwarded on input components, and all MDC events are forwarded.
- Labels and icons are named exports in the components that use them, or you can use the 'Label' and 'Icon' exports from '@smui/common'. (Except for chips labels and icons, textfield icons, and select icons, because they are special snowflakes.)
- SMUI [supports RTL languages](https://svelte.dev/repl/c2ff2d5dd5404eccb901ba04ef0161be?version=3.37.0).

## Integration for Sapper

<sub>\* As of 2021-Apr-06, these instructions will now work without a flash of unstyled content!</sub>

1. Install the following packages as dev dependencies
   - With yarn
     ```sh
     yarn add rollup-plugin-postcss sass --dev
     ```
   - With npm
     ```sh
     npm i -D rollup-plugin-postcss sass
     ```
2. Create the `src/theme/_smui-theme.scss` file

   ```sh
   mkdir src/theme && touch src/theme/_smui-theme.scss
   ```

3. Update `rollup.config.js` with the following configuration

   ```
   // ...
   // Put this along with the other imports.
   import postcss from "rollup-plugin-postcss";

   // ...

   // Insert the following right before the "export default {" line:
   const postcssOptions = (extract) => ({
      extensions: ['.scss'],
      extract: extract ? 'smui.css' : false,
      minimize: true,
      use: [
        [
          'sass',
          {
            includePaths: ['./src/theme', './node_modules'],
          },
        ],
      ],
    });

   // Right after the "svelte" plugin in the "client:" section, paste the following plugin.
   postcss(postcssOptions(true)),

   // Right after the "svelte" plugin in the "server:" section, paste the following plugin.
   postcss(postcssOptions(false)),

   // Don't touch the "serviceworker:" section.
   // ...
   ```

4. In the `template.html` file, in the `<head>` section right after `%sapper.base%`, paste the following

   ```
   <!-- SMUI Styles -->
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="client/smui.css">
   ```

5. Install a SMUI package, and include it from your Svelte files like this

   ```svelte
   <Button on:click={() => alert('Clicked!')}>Click Me!</Button>

   <script>
     import Button from '@smui/button';
   </script>
   ```

6. Profit!

## Loading SMUI in the Svelte REPL

Check out an [example REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl/aa857c3bb5eb478cbe6b1fd6c6da522a?version=3.37.0).

SMUI components provide "bare.css" and "bare.js" files to use in the REPL. In a `<svelte:head>` section, load from a CDN like UNPKG the CSS files for the fonts, for Material typography, and for each SMUI component you are using:

```svelte
<svelte:head>
  <!-- Fonts -->
  <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons"
  />
  <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,600,700"
  />

  <!-- Material Typography -->
  <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="https://unpkg.com/@material/typography@10.0.0/dist/mdc.typography.css"
  />

  <!-- SMUI -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@smui/button/bare.css" />
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/@smui/card/bare.css" />
</svelte:head>
```

Now load the Components, remembering to use the `/bare` script, from within a `<script>` section, and you can use them:

```svelte
<Button on:click={() => alert('See, I told you.')}>This is a button!</Button>

<Card style="width: 360px; margin: 2em auto;">
  <Content class="mdc-typography--body2">This is a card!</Content>
</Card>

<script>
  import Button from '@smui/button/bare';
  import Card, { Content } from '@smui/card/bare';
</script>
```

If you import from `@smui/common`, you don't need the `/bare` portion, since it doesn't have any Sass, so it can use the index file.

New components from the upstream library to build for SMUI v3:

- [x] Banners
- [x] Circular Progress
- [x] Layout Grids (Not new to MDC, but I haven't made a component for it.)
- [ ] Segmented Buttons (This is different than SMUI's button groups.)
- [ ] Tooltips
- [ ] Touch Target Wrappers
- [ ] Data Table Pagination
- [ ] Data Table Progress Indicator
- [ ] Data Table Column Sort Buttons

<sub>â€  This is Sass based, and therefore doesn't require Svelte components. I've included a demo showing how you can use it.</sub>

<sub>â€¡ This is not an MDC Web component. It is an addition that SMUI provides.</sub>

# Support

I'm a full time software engineer, and I work on this project in my free time. Unfortunately that means when I have to focus more on other things, I have less time to work on this project. I try to focus my time on whichever of my projects gets the most attention and community support. Right now, it's a toss up between PNotify and SMUI, but SMUI is consistently growing. If you want to see me focus on SMUI, star this repo. :)

You can support my work on this project through my other project, [Tunnelgram](https://tunnelgram.com). I have a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/tunnelgram) set up for it. I started this project in order to Materialize Tunnelgram.
